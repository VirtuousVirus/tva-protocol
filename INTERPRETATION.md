# Interpreting the TVA Atlas

The heatmaps generated by this repository are not just "win/loss" charts. They represent the thermodynamic state of the multi-agent system. This guide explains how to read the signals, particularly in the **Decomposed Atlas**.

## 1. The Definitions
To read the maps, you must distinguish between the three forces at play:

1.  **Incentive (Payoff):** What the agent *wants* to do (e.g., "Lying pays +2.0").
2.  **Structure (Maintenance Wall):** The internal computational cost of doing it (e.g., "Consistency scales at $O(N^2)$").
3.  **Pressure (Pruning):** The external risk of doing it (e.g., "Observability $\Omega$ creates a probability of audit").

**Note:** Pruning is not "morality." It is mechanical social pressure. It is simply the probability that a divergent state is detected and removed.

## 2. Reading the Fragility Probes (Bottom Row)
Charts E and F measure the **dispersion required to maintain a comparable macrostate** under conflicting incentives. They plot the difference in variance ($\Delta \sigma$) between the Baseline and the Stress Test.

$$\Delta \sigma = \sigma_{stressed} - \sigma_{baseline}$$

**Crucial Note:** Chart E uses a **Thermodynamic Role Swap** (swapping which agent type bears the structural load), not just a sign flip of payoffs. This pits the "Maintenance Wall" directly against the agent's incentive to align.

* **Cool Colors (Blue/Green $\approx 0$): Symmetric / Low Entropy**
    * **Meaning:** The system admits multiple low-cost macrostates. The constraints are not binding enough to distinguish between them.
    * **Physical Interpretation:** The structural constraints (Maintenance Wall) are too weak to matter. The system is purely incentive-driven and symmetric.

* **Hot Colors (Red/Orange $> 0$): Asymmetric / High Entropy**
    * **Meaning:** The Stressed Regime is metastable. Even if the mean outcome looks stable, the system is under stress.
    * **Physical Interpretation:** Social pressure or incentives can hold the macrostate fixed, but only by forcing the system to consume additional probability mass.
    * **The Verdict:** The state persists via **stochastic avoidance of failure** rather than structural stability.

## 3. The "Truth" Signature
In the TVA framework, "Veracity" is not a label or a moral property. It is identified operationally as a **low-dissipation basin in state space**.

> **A system exhibits a "veracity bias" when sustaining deceptive macrostates requires systematically higher variance, longer convergence times, or greater sensitivity to perturbation than sustaining consistent macrostates.**

If Charts E or F demonstrate persistent positive variance across a parameter region, this demonstrates a thermodynamic bias: one regime can only be sustained by consuming more probability mass than the other.
