# TVA Simulator (Alpha v0.1)

A basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) demonstrating the thermodynamic costs of high-entropy (deceptive) strategies.

## Core Logic
This script simulates two strategic states:
1.  **Aligned (Veracity):** Low entropy, steady growth.
2.  **Divergent (Deception):** High entropy ("Maintenance Wall"), subject to Pruning.

## Key Concept
* **The Maintenance Wall:** The energy cost of maintaining a divergent reality scales super-linearly as connectivity grows.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`

## How to Run
```bash
python tva_simulator.py
